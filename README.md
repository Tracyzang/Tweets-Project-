### Chirper

Chirper is a twitter clone app that built using react and redux. On the dashboard page, each tweet will show the author, the time stamp, who the author is replying to, the text of the tweet, a reply button - with the number of replies (if higher than 0), and also a like button - with the number of likes (if higher than 0).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
